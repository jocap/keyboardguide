# KeyboardGuide

KeyboardGuide is a website in the works, designed to help people decide what mechanical keyboard they should buy, based on their preferred switch, number of keys etc.  It's going to be a collaborative website, where users can add new keyboards (via the `add.php` form).

See the reddit thread for discussion.

## Why PHP?

**Question:**

> I don't see why anyone would EVER use plain PHP. It's like programming a self-driving car in assembly. Use something more civilised like Node.js, Django, Flask or even Rails!
Mind if I try my hand at "re-making" your site?

**Answer:**

> The thing is that PHP is a very simple web programming language that is accessible to a lot of people. I've used Node.js, Django, Rails, etc. I've even created an MVC framework in Node, but I chose PHP for its accessibility and simplicity. The site isn't really all that complicated.

## Planned Features

### API

**Comment:**

> Bravo, crowd sourcing this sort of information could make things easier for people trying to get their feet wet. Imagine a Bot that could access the information in KeyboardGuide and spit out answers in threads or the IRC channel.
